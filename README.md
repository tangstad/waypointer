WayPointer
==========

Just a silly project for experimenting and teaching TDD.

What does it do?
----------------

It doesn't do much, but it's trying to be a position tracker for entities
moving between waypoints in a 2D space, for examples enemies in a space shooter
video game.

API Documentation
-----------------

The API is in constant change, please just see the code for now.
